# Clustering-Fish-Species
This project aims to group fish based on their length and weight into three clusters. Each cluster has unique characteristics that reflect the size of the fish in terms of length and weight.
Cluster 1 (Large):
    Length: 7.66 - 24.35 cm
    Weight: 3.47 - 4.68 g
    Species: Otolithoides pama, Pethia conchonius, Polynemus paradiseus
Cluster 2 (Medium):
    Length: 6.36 - 25.76 cm
    Weight: 2.05 - 3.58 g
    Species: Anabas testudineus, Coilia dussumieri, Otolithoides biauritus
Cluster 3 (Small):
    Length: 9.69 - 19.48 cm
    Weight: 2.49 - 3.41 g
    Species: Puntius lateristriga, Setipinna taty
